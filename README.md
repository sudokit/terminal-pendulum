# terminal-pendulum
A cool little terminal pendulum made in ncurses and c while i was bored in class

(**WARNING** The code is absolutely horrible. I kind of recently picked up C and did this as my like 3rd project.)
Huge thanks to datenwolf for the awesome [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) library used in this project.
